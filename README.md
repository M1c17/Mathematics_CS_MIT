# Mathematics_CS_MIT

This repository contains all the recitations and Problems given in the Course [Mathematics for Computer Science](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-spring-2015/index.htm).

An alternate version with solutions to the problem sets is [here](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2005/assignments/).
Students struggling can consider the [Discrete Mathematics Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/discrete-mathematics) from Coursera first. It is more interactive but less comprehensive, and costs money to unlock full interactivity.

## Course Description

This subject offers an interactive introduction to discrete mathematics oriented toward computer science and engineering. The subject coverage divides roughly into thirds:

Fundamental concepts of mathematics: Definitions, proofs, sets, functions, relations.
Discrete structures: graphs, state machines, modular arithmetic, counting.
Discrete probability theory.
On completion of 6.042J, students will be able to explain and apply the basic methods of discrete (noncontinuous) mathematics in computer science. They will be able to use these methods in subsequent courses in the design and analysis of algorithms, computability theory, software engineering, and computer systems.

## Prerequisites

- [Calculus 1C](https://www.edx.org/course/calculus-1c-coordinate-systems-infinite-series).
